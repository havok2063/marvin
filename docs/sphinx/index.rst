Marvin Documentation
====================

Marvin is a tool specifically designed to visualise and analyse `MaNGA <https://www.sdss.org/manga>`_ data. It is developed and maintained by the MaNGA team. Marvin allows you to:

* Access reduced MaNGA datacubes local, remotely, or via a `web interface <https://dr15.sdss.org/marvin>`_.
* Access and visualise data analysis products.
* Perform powerful queries on data and metadata.
* Abstract the datamodel and forget where the data actually lives.
* Make good visualisation and scientific decisions by preventing common mistakes when accessing the data.

.. To install marvin simply run ``pip install sdss-marvin``. More details and known problem with installation can be found :ref:`here <marvin-installation>`.

.. note:: This documentation assumes that you are familiar with MaNGA data and its acronyms. If that is not your case, consider reading `this <https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/getting-started/>`_.

.. warning:: Marvin 2.x is the last version that will support Python 2.
  Marvin 3 and following will require Python 3.6+.
