- Added new test for image utilities getRandomImages, getImagesByPlate, getImagesByList
- Added new documentation on Image Utilities

### Changed:
- When marvin is running from source (not dist), `marvin.__version__` is `dev`.
- Removed the cleanUpQueries method to assess db stability
- Switched dogpile.cache from using a file to python-memcached
- Syntax changes and bug fixes to get Marvin Web working when Marvin run on 3.5
- Got Queries and Results working in 3.5
- Changed all convertToTool options in Results from mangaid to plateifu
- Added release explicitly into api query routes
- Modified the decision tree in query to throw an error in local mode
- Modified convertToTool to accept a mode keyword
- Modifed the MarvinError for optional Sentry exception catching, and github issue inclusion
- Updated all Marvin tests to turn off Sentry exception catching and the github message
- Updated some of the Tools Snippets on the web
- Overhauled Map plotting
    - uses DAP bitmasks (NOVALUE, BADVALUE, MATHERROR, BADFIT, and DONOTUSE)
    - adds percentile and sigma clipping
    - adds hatching for regions with data (i.e., a spectrum) but no measurement by the DAP
    - adds Linear Lab color map
    - adds option for logarithmic colorbar
    - adds option to use sky coordinates
    - adds map property name as title
    - makes plot square
    - sets plotting defaults:
        - cmap is linear_Lab (sequential)
        - cmap is RdBu_r (diverging) for velocity plots (Note: this is reversed from the sense of the default coolwarm    colormap in v2.0---red for positive velocities and blue for negative velocities)
        - cmap is inferno (sequential) for sigma plots
        - clips at 5th and 95th percentiles
        - clips at 10th and 90th percentiles for velocity and sigma plots
        - velocity plots are symmetric about 0
        - uses DAP bitmasks NOVALUE, BADVALUE, MATHERROR, BADFIT, and DONOTUSE
        - also masks spaxels with ivar=0
        - minimum SNR is 1
- Changed Marvin Plate path back to the standard MarvinToolsClass use
- Made sdss_access somewhat more Python 3 compatible
- Modified the image utilities to return local paths in local/remote modes and url paths when as_url is True
- downloadList utility function now downloads images

### Fixed:
- Issue #115: drpall does not get updated when a tool sets a custom release.
