What is Marvin?
---------------

Marvin is a complete ecosystem designed for overcoming the challenge of
searching, accessing, and visualizing the MaNGA data. It consists of a
three-pronged approach of a web app, a python package, and an API. The web app,
Marvin-web, provides an easily accesible interface for searching the MaNGA data
and visual exploration of individual MaNGA galaxies or of the entire sample. The
python package, in particular Marvin-tools, allows users to easily and
efficiently interact with the MaNGA data via local files, files retrieved from
the [Science Archive Server](https://sas.sdss.org), or data directly grabbed
from the database.  The tools come mainly in the form of convenience functions
and classes for interacting with the data. An additional tool is a powerful
query functionality that uses the API to query the MaNGA databases and return
the search results to your python session. Marvin-API is the critical link that
allows Marvin-tools and Marvin-web to interact with the databases, which enables
users to harness the statistical power of the MaNGA data set.
